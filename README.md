# WeatherAPI
Specifications: Create a single page web app that leverages asynchronous javascript to display the upcoming weather in a selected city using data from a public API. It should include: A field to enter a zip code. When the user submits the zip, async javascript should call an API (detailed below) to retrieve upcoming weather data. Using the returned data the app should display date/time, temperature and pressure in a table.  City names should also appear at the top of the table. API Info: Use the API at https://openweathermap.org/ This will require you sign up for a free account to get an API key. The API route to use is: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?zip=[ZIP CODE],us&amp;APPID=[YOUR API KEY] API route documentation: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 Use JSON and not XML for data returns. Bonus points for: Using a CSS framework to make it look nice (e.g. Bootstrap), or roll your own styling. Build in exception handling (such as entering in a malformed zip code or one that does not exist). Build in user feedback of application state (loading, error, etc.).
